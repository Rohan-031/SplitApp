# SplitApp


This is a simple backend project made by a student for tracking and splitting group expenses. It lets you add expenses (like dinner, movie, etc.), choose who paid, and automatically calculates who owes whom â€” with fewer transactions!

## What It Does

- Add group expenses (amount, description, who paid, who was involved)
- Split expenses equally between users
- Calculate fair share of each person
- Show who should pay whom and how much (settlement)
- Useful for friends, roommates, or trip groups

## Tech Used

- Node.js (backend)
- Express.js (routing)
- MongoDB Atlas (database)
- Mongoose (for connecting to MongoDB)
